# Pulpo Ludo

This application is the future **Netflix of the board games**. The first version of this site has been realized during the final project of the Fullstack Web training of [The Hacking Project](https://www.thehackingproject.org/).

Many thanks to our mentor [Anthony Amar](https://github.com/anthonyamar) for his availability and advices throughout this final project. Whether from a purely technical point of view or in terms of business model, he was able to guide us and frame the priorities to achieve this first deliverable. And of course thank you very much to the whole community of The Hacking Project, who made it possible to build a complex web application after only a few weeks of training.
